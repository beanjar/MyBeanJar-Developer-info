MyBeanJar- Developer/Publisher requirements

MyBeanJar 'Rewardware'  is a relevant reward redeemable at the right time & place.  Game players win real value coupons as rewards for achievements, delivered right into a mobile wallet. The wallet reminds the player later so it won't interrupt their gameflow at that moment.
